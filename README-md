## Question:

During a training session each athlete of a group of professional
cyclists is checked during each lap.
For each athlete all lap times are stored in a file with the following
format.
The first line of the file stores the number of cyclists in the group.
Then, for each cyclist, the file stores:
- On the first line, his/her name (string of 30 characters at most),
  identifier (integer value), and number of laps performed.
- On the second line, all lap times,
  time_1 time_2 ... time_N, stored as real values.

Write a program that, after reading the file and storing its content
in a proper data structure, is able to reply to the following menu
inquiry:
- list: the program prints-out the number of athletes, their names,
  identifiers, and number of laps performed.
- detail name: given an athlete name, the program prints-out
  his/her identifier, and all lap times.
- best: the program prints-out the name, identifier, all lap times
  and the average lap time for the athlete whose average lap time is
  smaller.
- stop: end the program.

Notice that all operations can be performed more than once till the
stop command is issued.

### Example:
Let the following be the input file:

4
Rossi 100 3
1.30 1.38 1.29
Bianchi 101 5
1.46 1.43 1.42 1.51 1.28
Neri 117 2 
1.26 1.34
Verdi 89 4
2.01 1.45 1.43 1.38

The following is a run example of the program:

Input file name: cyclist.txt
Command? list
Number of athletes : 4
Name: Rossi #Id:100 #Laps:3
Name: Bianchi #Id:101 #Laps:5
Name: Neri #Id:117 #Laps:2
Name: Verdi #Id:89 #Laps:4
Command? best
Name:Neri #Id number:117 Laps:2 Times: 1.26 1.34 (Average:1.30)
Command? details Bianchi
#Id:101 #Laps:5 Times: 1.46 1.43 1.42 1.51 1.28
Command? stop
Program ended.
